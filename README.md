# General Tools

## General Tools designed to construct almost any application that relies on socket communication

This repository serves mainly as a tooling. Code here allows construction of any program that requires
socket communication between the server and the client.

General Tools are supposed to be imported to other implementations, as main constructions are designed
to return data to the 'clienting' application.
